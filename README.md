## Introduction

üë®‚Äçüíª Author and Owner: [Andreas Elledge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-elledge-306813135/)

This project explores the potential for cross-exchange arbitrage in the cryptocurrency market, focusing on Bitcoin ($BTC) prices on Binance and Kraken.
Through Python-based data analysis and real-time market data, we determine whether arbitrage opportunities still exist.
This project serves as a tutorial and is not financial advice.

I'm the author and owner of this work, and it's also featured in a Medium article that you can read [here](https://medium.com/@andreas26/are-there-any-cross-exchange-arbitrage-opportunities-left-a-python-series-40ffb51626f5).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, requests, datetime
- Basic understanding of cryptocurrency trading and arbitrage strategies

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install numpy
    ```

3. Run the notebook or script.

## Features

- Fetch real-time $BTC data from Binance and Kraken APIs.
- Merge and analyze the data to identify arbitrage opportunities.
- Include trading fees in profit calculations.
- Generate buy/sell signals based on price discrepancies.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to understand the process of:
- Fetching data
- Merging and analyzing data
- Identifying arbitrage opportunities
- Calculating potential profits
